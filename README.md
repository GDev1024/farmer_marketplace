## 📌 Project Title  
**Farmer Marketplace App & Website** – A platform connecting Grenadian farmers directly with consumers to buy and sell fresh produce efficiently.
---

## 🌱 Local Context  
In Grenada, small farmers play a vital role in supplying fresh produce, but supply-demand gaps often lead to food waste or inconsistent access for consumers. This marketplace helps bridge that gap by enabling direct trade, supporting local agriculture, and reducing waste.

---

## 📝 Project Description  
The Farmer Marketplace App & Website is a **full-stack application** where users can:

- Browse farm products  
- Create product listings  
- Place and track orders  

Farmers can optionally **verify their accounts** by submitting a Farmer ID, giving them a “verified” status. The frontend is built with JavaScript / PHP, and the backend is a **PHP + MySQL API** managed via **phpMyAdmin**.


---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Build a working frontend + backend for a local farmer marketplace  
2. Enable farmer verification via Farmer ID  
3. Implement CRUD functionality for product listings  
4. Support order creation, tracking, and reviews  
5. Persist all data securely in a MySQL database
