# Farmer Marketplace App – Final Project

## Project Title
**Farmer Marketplace** – A Flutter-based mobile and web platform connecting farmers directly with customers for fresh produce sales.

## Project Description
The Farmer Marketplace app is designed to showcase a working demo of buying and selling fresh agricultural products. Farmers can add products, and customers can browse and purchase items. This demo focuses on the core front-end functionality, with no backend or database connected yet.

## Problem Statement
Many farmers face difficulties reaching customers directly, often relying on intermediaries that reduce profit margins. Customers, in turn, struggle to access fresh, locally-produced goods conveniently. This app demonstrates a solution by connecting farmers and consumers in a simple, functional demo.

## Objectives
1. Demonstrate a functional front-end for farmers and customers.  
2. Showcase product listing, browsing, and cart functionality.  
3. Provide a basic interface for order tracking (demo only).  

## Features
- Farmer profile and product listing (demo data)  
- Customer product browsing and search  
- Shopping cart for demo purchases  

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart) for iOS, Android, and Web  
- **Backend/Database**: None yet (demo uses static or mock data)  

## Usage
- Open the app and sign up as either a **farmer** or a **customer**  
- **Farmers**: Add products through “My Products” → “Add New”  
- **Customers**: Browse products, add items to cart (demo functionality)  


## Project Evaluation
### Achievements
- Fully functional front-end demo for farmers and customers
