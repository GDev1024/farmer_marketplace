## 📌 Project Title
**Farmer Marketplace App & Website** – A platform connecting Grenadian farmers directly with consumers to buy and sell fresh produce efficiently.

---

## 📝 Project Description
The Farmer Marketplace App & Website is a **working front-end demo** where users can **browse products, create listings, and track orders**. All users can post and view listings, while farmers can optionally **verify their accounts** by submitting a **Farmer ID** to gain verified status. The project highlights **core functionality and UI/UX design** for a local marketplace platform without a backend.

This project provides a **Local Farmers Marketplace** where users can buy and sell produce directly, helping reduce waste, support local agriculture, and create economic benefits for farmers and customers alike.
